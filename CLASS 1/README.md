# what is data structure?
Arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently in memory.

# What is algorithm?
Sequence of steps on data using efficient data structure to solve a given problem.

# What is time complexity?
How time taken to execute an algorithm grows with the size of the input.

# What is Big Oh notation (O)?
This is related to time and space increases with respect to input.
Used to describe osymptotic upper bound . 
  Mathmathecally, A function f(n) siad to be Big Oh if and only if there exist positive constants C and n(not) such that 
  0<=f(x)<=cg(n) for all n>n(not)

# Example of Big Oh notation?
O(n) ,O(logn) ,O(n^2)
